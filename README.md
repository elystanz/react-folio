## <a id="introduction">Introduction</a>
This React.js portfolio is a simple site designed to be easily navigatable, updateable, and versatile. I have plans to further improve this site which are outlined in the roadmap section of this README, as I really enjoyed to workflow of React.js.

In this portfolio, you will see a short biography, as I'm not a huge share-everything-online type! It is followed by a few of my favorite projects I had worked on through the duration of the course, and I plan to add more in a more visually pleasing fashion (once I get more well-acquainted with React). After, my resume is posted to the page. At the footer, you'll find links to my GitHub, LinkedIn profile, and my email address.

If you've cloned the repository, open your terminal and enter `npm i` to install all required dependencies. Run `npm start` to begin the server and view the portfolio!

## <a id="application">Application</a>
Here is the application in use:

This application requires the following dependencies to run, which are already declared within the package.json file:

* @testing-library/jest-dom: ^5.16.4
* @testing-library/react: ^13.3.0
* @testing-library/user-event: ^13.5.0
* react: ^18.2.0
* react-dom: ^18.2.0
* react-router-dom: ^6.3.0
* react-scripts: 5.0.1
* web-vitals: ^2.1.4

## <a id="roadmap">Roadmap</a>
I plan to add a more extensive, separate portfolio page that includes not only my web development achievements but my audio career achievements and experiences. I think it would be great to make this an overall portfolio site I can send to a variety of potential employers, clients, or colleagues.

## <a id=#status>Project Status</a>
The navigation has been giving me issues and will break the page when react-router-dom is initiated. For the sake of functionality, it has been left out of the navigation component for the time being.
